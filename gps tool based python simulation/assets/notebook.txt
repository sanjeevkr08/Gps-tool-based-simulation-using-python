To create a simulation for a GPS-based toll collection system using Python, you can follow these steps:

Define the Problem Scope:

Create a mock dataset of vehicles, GPS coordinates, and toll zones.
Define toll rates for different zones.
Simulate vehicle movements and calculate toll charges based on distances traveled within toll zones.


Set Up the Environment:

Install necessary Python libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, Geopy for geospatial calculations, and Matplotlib for plotting.


Design the Simulation:

Define classes for vehicles, toll zones, and the toll collection system.
Implement methods to calculate distances traveled within toll zones.
Aggregate and calculate total toll charges for each vehicle.


Implement the Simulation in Python:

Write Python code to simulate vehicle movements, track GPS coordinates, and calculate toll charges.



Explanation


1-Data Preparation: We create mock data for vehicle movements
 and define toll zones.

2-Classes: We define the TollZone and Vehicle classes to 
encapsulate their properties and behaviors.

3-Simulation: We simulate vehicle movements and calculate toll
 charges based on distances traveled within toll zones.

4-Excel Export: We prepare the data for export and save it into an
 Excel file using pandas.ExcelWriter.
The resulting Excel file, toll_data.xlsx,
 will contain two sheets:

5-Movements: Detailed movements of each vehicle with timestamps
 and coordinates.

6-Total_Toll: Total toll charges for each vehicle.

Summary


This program simulates a GPS-based toll collection system. 
It defines toll zones and vehicles, simulates vehicle movements,
calculates the distance traveled within toll zones, and computes 
the toll charges. The data is visualized using Matplotlib.
